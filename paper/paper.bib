  abstract = "Recent years have seen an increase in alarming signals regarding
              the lack of replicability in neuroscience, psychology, and other
              related fields. To avoid a widespread crisis in neuroimaging
              research and consequent loss of credibility in the public eye, we
              need to improve how we do science. This article aims to be a
              practical guide for researchers at any stage of their careers
              that will help them make their research more reproducible and
              transparent while minimizing the additional effort that this
              might require. The guide covers three major topics in open
              science (data, code, and publications) and offers practical
              advice as well as highlighting advantages of adopting more open
              research practices that go beyond improved transparency and
              reproducibility.",

  abstract = "The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques
              has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of
              thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and
              diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive
              study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used
              to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no
              widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data
              collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and
              reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible
              and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic
              pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem,
              we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a
              standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS
              standard uses file formats compatible with existing software,
              unifies the majority of practices already common in the field,
              and captures the metadata necessary for most common data
              processing operations.",

  abstract = "The rate of progress in human neurosciences is limited by the
              inability to easily apply a wide range of analysis methods to the
              plethora of different datasets acquired in labs around the world.
              In this work, we introduce a framework for creating, testing,
              versioning and archiving portable applications for analyzing
              neuroimaging data organized and described in compliance with the
              Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). The portability of these
              applications (BIDS Apps) is achieved by using container
              technologies that encapsulate all binary and other dependencies
              in one convenient package. BIDS Apps run on all three major
              operating systems with no need for complex setup and
              configuration and thanks to the comprehensiveness of the BIDS
              standard they require little manual user input. Previous
              containerized data processing solutions were limited to single
              user environments and not compatible with most multi-tenant High
              Performance Computing systems. BIDS Apps overcome this limitation
              by taking advantage of the Singularity container technology. As a
              proof of concept, this work is accompanied by 22 ready to use
              BIDS Apps, packaging a diverse set of commonly used neuroimaging
              algorithms.",

              However, concerns have recently been raised that the conclusions
              that are drawn from some human neuroimaging studies are either
              spurious or not generalizable. Problems such as low statistical
              power, flexibility in data analysis, software errors and a lack
              of direct replication apply to many fields, but perhaps
              particularly to functional MRI. Here, we discuss these problems,
              outline current and suggested best practices, and describe how we
              think the field should evolve to produce the most meaningful and
              reliable answers to neuroscientific questions.",
